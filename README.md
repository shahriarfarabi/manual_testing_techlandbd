## Test Plan

This test plan aims to define the testing strategy and approach for the login page and footer of the TechLand BD website. This document will outline the objectives, scope, resources, testing data, test items, test approach, test deliverables, test environment, entry and exit criteria, risk and contingencies, and schedule for the testing activities, ensuring that the login and footer functionality meets the specified requirements and performs reliably under various conditions.

The mind maps are located in the Test Plan excel sheet.
## Mind Maps

Mind maps were created to visualize the structure and flow of the login page and footer elements. These diagrams help in understanding the components and their interactions.

The mind maps are located in the Mind Maps excel sheet.
## Report

Detailed reports were generated based on the execution of the test cases. These reports provide insights into the testing progress and outcomes. According to the report, out of a total of 62 test cases, 38 test cases have passed, while 24 test cases have failed. This indicates a success rate of approximately 61%. The failed test cases will need to be analyzed to identify the underlying issues. Addressing these failures promptly will be crucial to ensure the overall quality and reliability of the system. Further testing and debugging efforts will be required to improve the success rate and achieve the desired level of performance.

You can find the reports in the Report excel sheet.
